# **Django App: NYC Guide**
This app is the creation of a new django project called ‘NYC-Guide’.
A Django app that provides the user with information about NYC’s five boroughs and points of interest therein.

In NYC the five boroughs have various activities and venues. Their descriptions are listed in the app. You will have the opportunity to visit each borough individually and also start over, in case you want to view the activites and the descriptions again.
